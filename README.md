# Self-Driving-Cars-Engine
trying to cover signal processing, lane detection, color detection, and object detection for self-driving car purpose

## What-Done

1. Signal processing (1D smoothing, 2D smoothing, convolution 2 signals, pass-filters)
2. Simple straight lane detection
3. Steering suggestion
4. Multi-lane detection
5. Multi-lane angle

## Results

1. Signal processing
